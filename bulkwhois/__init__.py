class BulkWhois(object):
    """
        Query a list of IP addresses from a bulk whois server. This is an 
        efficient way to query a large number of IP addresses. It sends all
        the IP addresses at once, and receives all whois results together.

        This module takes the approach that you know what you're doing: if
        you have non-IP data in there (such as hostnames), the whois server
        will ignore them and they won't be included in results.

        This class is not designed to be called directly: rather, use one of
        the subclass interfaces to specific bulk whois servers such as 
        bulkwhois.cymru or bulkwhois.shadowserver, which are set to appropriate
        default settings for those services.

        Usage:

        import BulkWhois from bulkwhois

        bw = BulkWhois()
        records = lookup_ips(["192.168.0.1", "10.1.1.1"])

        Args:
            leader: Any text that needs to appear before the bulk whois query
            footer: Any text that needs to appear after the bulk whois query
            server: the hostname of the whois server to use
            port: the whois server port number to connect to
            record_delim: the char to split records received from the server
                          who
            field_delim: the char to split individual fields in each record
            has_results_header: set to True if the whois server send a header
                                line in the results which has no whois data
            fields: a list defining the order of the names of the fields 
                    returned by the server. Used to populate the dict returned.
